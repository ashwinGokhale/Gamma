# Gamma

`gamma ` is a tool for managing all git repos on your local machine.

NOTE: Gamma has only been tested on a Unix system

## Installation
```
npm i -g gamma-cli
```

## Usage
```
$ gamma --help

  Usage: gamma [options] [command]


  Options:

    -h, --help  output usage information


  Commands:

    list|l [options] [bases...]      List all git repos in the base(s)
    search|s <base>                  Fuzzy matches a git repo inside the context base
    init|i                           Initializes the gamma dotfile
    install|ins                      Installs the 'ad' command, which cd's into a git repo fuzzy matching a repo in the context base
    add|a <base> [otherBases...]     Adds the specified bases as well as all git repos in them
    remove|r <base> [otherBases...]  Removes the specified bases from Gamma
    set [options]                    Set the base or repo of the context
    run [options]                    Runs a git command in the context
    rebase|re [bases...]             Rescan base(s) and removes any base or repo that does not exist anymore
    daemon|d                         Runs background process that maintains all bases and their repos
```

## How does it work?
Gamma keeps track of "base" directories and from those, it tracks all git repos in them.  
Gamma also has something called the "context" which contains the default base directory and default repo.  
The context base is used for commands like 'search' and the context repo is used for commands like 'run'.

## GD command


Cd'ing to your projects is harder than it should be.
There are [attempts](https://github.com/rupa/z) to solve this
problem using frequency and recency.
`pro` solves the problem by fuzzy searching only git repositories.

The supplementary `pd` command allows you to instantly CD to any git repo by
fuzzy matching its name. It is implemented as a shell function.
You can install `pd` (name configurable) by running `pro install`.
Once you have it you can do some pretty intense cd'ing:

**Protip:** running `pd` with no arguments changes to the pro base.

## State of the Repos Address

Oftentimes I find myself wondering which git repositories of mine still have
uncommitted changes or unpushed commits. I could find them all and run git
status but it would be nice to get a quick overview. `pro status` does this.

![pro status](http://thume.ca/assets/postassets/pro/pro_status.png)

You can also run `pro status <repo>` to show the output of `git status` for a
certain repo.

## Run all the commands!

Wouldn't it be cool if you could run a command on all your repos and see a
summary of the output? Now you can!

You can do this with `pro run <command>`. If you don't pass a command it will
prompt you for one.

For example, searching all your repos for ruby files:

![pro run](http://thume.ca/assets/postassets/pro/pro_run.png)

Notice that it double checks before running so you don't accidentally run
`rm -rf *` on all your projects.

## The Pro Base

`pro` can use a base directory to narrow down its search for git repos. By default it
uses your home folder.

To set the base directory set the PRO_BASE environment variable or make
a ~/.proBase file containing the path. The .proBase file can contain many lines
each with a path to a folder to search. Pro will search the path in the PRO_BASE
variable as well as all paths in the .proBase file. If neither exists then the home
directory will be used.

## Indexing

Whenever you run a `pro` command or `pd` it will kick off a background indexing process.
This process can run anywhere from less than a second to a minuted depending on the number
of files in your pro bases.

On update the cache is invalidated and you may have to wait a while before your command
finishes.

## Installation

`pro` is bundled as a Ruby gem. To install run:

    $ gem install pro

You may also want to set your Pro Base. See the above section.

## Usage

    pro is a command to help you manage your git repositories.

    Base Directory ==========
    pro works from a base directory for efficiency.
    This is the folder that contains all your other git repositories;
    they don't have to be at the base level, just somewhere down the tree.

    To set the base directory set the PRO_BASE environment variable or make
    a ~/.proBase file containing the path. The .proBase file can contain many lines
    each with a path to a folder to search. Pro will search the path in the PRO_BASE
    variable as well as all paths in the .proBase file. If neither exists then the home
    directory will be used.

    Commands ===============
    pro search <query> - prints path of git repo that matches query.
    pro status - prints a list of all repos with uncommitted or unpushed changes.
    pro status <name> - prints the output of 'git status' on the repo.
    pro run - prompts for a command to run in all git repos.
    pro run <command> - runs the given command in all git repos.
    pro list - prints the paths to all repos. Intended for scripting.
    pro bases - prints the paths to all bases. Intended for scripting.
    pro install - Install the pro cd command. cd to a directory by fuzzy git repo matching.
    pro help - display help

    CD Command ============
    You can use the 'pro install' command to install a wrapper shell function that allows
    you to cd to git repositories in your Pro Base wherever you are based on fuzzy matching.

    Just running 'pd' cd's to the pro base.

    Example:

      ~/randomFolder/ $ pd pro
      pro/ $ pwd
      /Users/tristan/Box/Dev/Projects/pro
      pro/ $ pd
      Dev/ $ pwd
      /Users/tristan/Box/Dev
